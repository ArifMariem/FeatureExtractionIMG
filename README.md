# Image Feature Extraction and Matching

## Overview

This repository focuses on image feature extraction and matching using the OpenCV library. The primary goal is to use feature matching techniques to fix rotation discrepancies between two images or detect similarities between them. Feature matching, in this context, refers to the process of identifying corresponding features in two similar images based on a distance-based search algorithm. This technique is utilized to find, derive, and transfer attributes from a source image to a target image.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Matching:** The process involves analyzing the topology of both the source and target images, detecting feature patterns, and establishing correspondences between these patterns. This matching process aims to identify and transfer key attributes from the source image to the target image.

- **OpenCV and ORB Algorithm:** The feature extraction and matching are implemented using the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm provided by OpenCV. The ORB algorithm combines speed and accuracy for feature extraction.

- **Brute-Force Matcher:** The code utilizes the Brute-Force Matcher from OpenCV to perform feature matching. Specifically, the `cv2.BFMatcher()` is used to find the best matches between the features extracted from two images.

## Usage

1. **Image Preparation:** Ensure the images (img1 and img2) are appropriately loaded or provided.

2. **Run the Code:** Execute the provided code in a Python environment that has OpenCV and Matplotlib installed.

3. **Result Visualization:** The code generates a visualization showing the matched features between the two images.
